# MQTT-Automations

This project is an application that helps with my everyday automations. It works in conjunction with my Home Assistant instance (via MQTT) to automate various tasks. The application gives me greater control of my Spotify through Home Assistant and automatically copies Home Assistant backups to my Dropbox folder.
